    <h3>One Tree Planted partnership</h3>
    <p>In a small effort to help support the environment, I've partnered with One Tree Planted to assist in global reforestation projects. $10 from every print sold will go towards planting trees across the globe. According to One Tree Planted, each tree is $1, so for every print that you purchase 10 trees are planted.</p>
