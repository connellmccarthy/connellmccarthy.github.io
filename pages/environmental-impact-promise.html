    <h3>One Tree Planted partnership</h3>
    <p>In a small effort to help support the environment, I've partnered with One Tree Planted to assist in global reforestation projects. $10 from every print sold will go towards planting trees across the globe. According to One Tree Planted, each tree is $1, so for every print that you purchase 10 trees are planted.</p>

    <h3>Paper Sourcing</h3>
    <p>My printers use Epson Photography Paper due to the unmatched quality, and their dedication to the environment. When it comes to procuring the paper, Epson has established a policy that:
      <ol>
        <li>Makes effective use of used paper and other recyled pulp.</li>
        <li>When virgin is used as a raw material in paper goods they procure, they confirm its
          <ul>
            <li>legality</li>
            <li>sustainability</li>
            <li>chemical safety</li>
            <li>environmental management</li>
          </ul>

    <p class="muted m-0">That's pretty incredible. Loss of forests contributes between 12 to 17 percent of annual global greenhouse gas emissions, so every little bit helps.</p>
