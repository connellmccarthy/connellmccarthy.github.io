I had the opportunity to work on the go-to-market campaign for the latest Shopify product launch, [POS Go](https://www.shopify.com/pos/meet-pos-go?utm_source=connellmccarthy.com){: target="blank"} - the all-in-one mobile POS system built for seamless store checkouts.

## Creative direction

This campaign has been a long time coming with a couple speed bumps along the way, but even with the challenges we faced, the team stayed resilient and motivated to create a beautiful campaign. We wanted a creative direction that felt in line with the rest of our brand, but also something that could stand as a moment in time.

The colour palette was the piece of the campaign that brought it all together. We used grounded and warm neutral colours as the main pillars to keep it approachable, while pairing them alongside chartreuse to add the boldness it needed.

We prioritized applying the campaign creative to the landing pages first, so that we could see it all together in one place, and then take pieces of it and repurpose it for other touchpoints like ads, direct mail, paid social, and emails.
